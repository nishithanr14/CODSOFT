# Iris Flower Classification

This project classifies iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica
using sepal and petal measurements with machine learning.
Iris Flower Classification
📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

The classification is done using machine learning models based on sepal and petal measurements.

This is a classic beginner-friendly classification problem and is part of the CODSOFT Data Science Internship.
