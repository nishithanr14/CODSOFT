# Iris Flower Classification

This project classifies iris flowers into Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica
using sepal and petal measurements with machine learning.

This project focuses on classifying Iris flowers into three species:

Setosa

Versicolor

Virginica

The classification is done using machine learning models based on sepal and petal measurements.

This is a classic beginner-friendly classification problem and is part of the CODSOFT Data Science Internship.

# Dataset

Dataset: Iris Flower Dataset

Source: sklearn.datasets.load_iris

Total records: 150

Features:

Sepal Length

Sepal Width

Petal Length

Petal Width

# Target:

Species (0 = Setosa, 1 = Versicolor, 2 = Virginica)

# Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

# Machine Learning Models Used

Logistic Regression

Random Forest Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Feature scaling was done using StandardScaler where required.

# Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using:

Training Accuracy

Testing Accuracy

# Sample Results:

Logistic Regression: ~97%

Random Forest: ~95–100%

KNN: ~95%

(Random Forest achieved the best performance.)

# Model Testing

The trained model was also tested on new input data to predict the Iris flower species.

# Conclusion

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow:

Data loading

Preprocessing

Model training

Evaluation

Prediction

It serves as a strong foundation for understanding classification problems in machine learning.
