# Sales Prediction

This project predicts product sales using machine learning techniques based on advertising expenditure across different media channels.

The objective of this task is to build a model that can accurately predict sales using features such as TV, Radio, and Newspaper advertising spend.

## Project Description

Sales prediction plays an important role in business decision-making by helping companies understand the impact of advertising investments on product sales.

In this project, machine learning regression models are used to analyze and predict sales based on historical advertising data.

## Dataset

Dataset Name: Advertising Dataset

File Name: advertising.csv

Source: Standard dataset used for regression tasks

## Dataset Information

Total Records: 200

Features:

  TV – Advertising spend on TV

  Radio – Advertising spend on Radio

  Newspaper – Advertising spend on Newspaper

Target Variable:

  Sales – Product sales

## Technologies Used

Python

Jupyter Notebook

Pandas

## Machine Learning Models Used

Linear Regression

Multiple Linear Regression

Feature analysis and preprocessing were performed before training the models.

## Model Evaluation

The models were evaluated using:

  Training and Testing Performance

  R² Score

  Mean Squared Error (MSE)

The regression models demonstrated good performance in predicting sales.

## Model Testing

The trained model was tested on new advertising data to predict sales values.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the complete machine learning workflow required for the CODSOFT Sales Prediction task:

Data loading

Data preprocessing

Exploratory data analysis

Model training

Model evaluation

Sales prediction

It provides practical experience in solving real-world regression problems using machine learning.
